In this paper, we will address different topics such as graphs, centralities in graphs, and the central concept in this paper, the Strahler Number. With this concept of the Strahler number, we will approach using different tools previously defined in the previous paper in order to find a relation between the Strahler number and centrality in a graph. First, we will define important concepts such as centrality, a tree, etc. Next, we will provide a definition of the Strahler number, and finally, we will explore (if any) the relationships between the tools we defined and the Strahler number, as well as some projections and remaining work to be done.

\paragraph{Graphs} A graph is a pair $G = (V, E)$ where $V$ is a finite set and $E \subseteq V\times V$ is a finite relation. Each par of vertex let be $(v_{1},v_{2})$ , $v_{1},v_{2} \in V$ this set of vertex its called edges and can be directed or not, so the edges $\in E$. A path in a graph is a sequence of non-repeated nodes connected through edges present in a graph, if there exist a path between two vertex, this vertex are called connected. An example, let be $x,y \in V$ a path can be expressed so $\{x,x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,y_{1},y_{2},\cdots,y_{n} \}$ with $x,x_{i},y_{i},y \in V$

\paragraph{Trees} A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by only and only one path. A rooted tree is refereed as a tree with a vertex who serves as the "root" of the tree, being a references to the others  vertices in the tree.

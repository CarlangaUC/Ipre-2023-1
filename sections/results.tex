We can observe that the Strahler number is similar to a centrality measure, in a sense which, is a function who takes a node an assigns a score (with certain conditions), that's why the co-relation between Strahler number is visible. We can define the centrality measure using Strahler number in which sense, a higher Strahler number means higher centrality, its valid to inquire if this centrality roots trees.

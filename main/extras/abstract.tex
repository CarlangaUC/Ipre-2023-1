 Centrality measures are widely used to assign importance to graph-structured data. This way of analyzing a graph has given so much interpretation to different graphs, in such ways that, we can formalize concepts such as importance in a graph by using this measure. Previously in a different paper, we present the formalization of this concepts, using potential functions as a way of viewing the rooting proper tie of different centralities, in this paper we analyze this concept in a centrality we define using Strahler number, a concept that has has been in the records for a while.

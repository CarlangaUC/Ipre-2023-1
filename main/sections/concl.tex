The Strahler number is a concept that as we saw, we can associate with a potential function and in such way a centrality. Knowing this and using the concept and properties of the potential function, we can assure that it will no root trees in all cases, in such way that we establish a cases in which this centrality does not root and by extend, it will not root in all cases. We formalize this by using the concepts of monoids and his relation with potential function, finding that we can not find a monoid in such way that it can form a potential function.

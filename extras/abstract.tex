Centrality measures are widely used to assign importance to graph-structured data. This approach to graph analysis has provided various interpretations for different graphs, allowing us to formalize concepts such as graph importance using these measures. In a previous paper, we presented the formalization of these concepts, utilizing potential functions to capture the rooting property of different centralities. In this work, we analyse the concept of the Strahler number as a centrality and examine different properties and beyond.
